# How to use a Swap

[BOASwap Swap](https://testnet.boaswap.io/#/swap)Connect to using a Chrome browser.

Before using BOASwap, the MetaMask (Wallet) must be installed and connected.
Explain the scenario of exchanging a BOSAGORA BizNet BOA for a demo token (ETK) in BOASwap.
The current screenshot image is the situation of BizTestNet. The actual run must be run on BizNet.

* First, verify that the network is selected as BizNet and connected.
* The requirement is BOA from BizNet.
* The process is similar to the experience of using UNISwap.

* Enter the amount to be exchanged. If you enter the input token amount amount at the top, the amount of tokens you will receive is determined by the liquidity price curve of the BOASwap DEX Protocol.
* The fees is measured at 1.5%, which is the sum of the liquidity provider fee and the protocol fee.
* Approve runs when swapping, and a small amount of network gas cost is required for swapping.

* The settings pop-up lets you set up Slippage Tolerance and Transaction Deadline.
* Slippage Tolerance represents the difference between the expected output and the actual output at the time the transaction was executed. If the price changes above the set slipage limit, the transaction will be canceled.
* Transaction deadline sets the default transaction closing to 20 minutes to prevent users from executing transactions at bad prices after significant price changes.
* If the gas price is not set high enough, the transaction may reach deadline.
