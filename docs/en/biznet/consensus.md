# Consensus Engine

We target to design the consensus engine of BizNet to achieve the following goals:

1. Wait a few blocks to confirm(should be less than Ethereum 1.0), better no fork in most cases.
2. Blocking time should be the same as Ethereum network.
3. No inflation, the block reward is transaction gas fees.
4. As much as compatible as Ethereum.
5. It allows modern blockchain network governance.The network will start with POA and gradually convert to POS
