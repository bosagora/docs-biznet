# BizNet MainNet

## What is Mainnet?
Mainnet is the term used to describe when a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, 
meaning that cryptocurrency transactions are being broadcasted, 
verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain).

BizNet's mainnet can be used for deploying actual dApps on the BizNet blockchain ad perform real transactions. 
Since this is the actual network, you will require to purchase real BOA tokens to perform different operations on the network.

## How to Access BizNet
There are multiple ways to access the BizNet mainnet. 
One possible method is to join the mainnet as an [observer node](running_node/node.md). 
You can also use the RPC endpoints specified [here](rpc.md) to connect to the mainnet. 
RPC endpoints may be used to interact with a node directly over HTTP or websockets. 
Using RPC, you may perform low-level operations like executing ABCI queries, 
viewing network/consensus state or broadcasting a transaction.
RPC endpoints are also used with web wallets like [MetaMask](../wallet/tutorials/metamask.md) to connect to the BizNet mainnet.

## How to Build on BizNet
You can build deploy [smart contracts](deploy_smart_contract/remix.md), [NFTs](nft/metadata.md), 
[ERC20 Tokens](token/intoroduction.md) on the BizNet.
