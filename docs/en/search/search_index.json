Mainnet is the term used to describe when a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, meaning that cryptocurrency transactions are being broadcasted, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain).

Since this is the actual network, you will require to purchase real BOA tokens to perform different operations on the network. How to Access BizNet There are multiple ways to access the BizNet mainnet. One possible method is to join the mainnet as an observer node . You can also use the RPC endpoints specified here to connect to the mainnet. RPC endpoints may be used to interact with a node directly over HTTP or websockets. Using RPC, you may perform low-level operations like executing ABCI queries, viewing network/consensus state or broadcasting a transaction.

Please install the following: Requirements: Windows, Linux or Mac OS X Node.js v8.9.4 LTS or later Git Recommendations for Windows If you're running Truffle on Windows, you may encounter some naming conflicts that could prevent Truffle from executing properly. Please see the section on resolving naming conflicts for solutions. Installing Truffle Once we have those installed, we only need one command to install Truffle: npm install -g truffle To verify that Truffle is installed properly, type truffle version on a terminal. If you see an error, make sure that your npm modules are added to your path. Project Creation, Compilation, and Configuration The first step is to create a Truffle project. We'll use the *MegaCoin as an example, which creates a token that can be transferred between accounts: Create a new directory for your Truffle project mkdir MegaCoin cd MegaCoin Intialize your project: To initialize your project use the following command truffle init Once this operation is completed, you'll now have a project structure with the following items: contracts/: Directory for Solidity contracts migrations/: Directory for scriptable deployment files test/: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts truffle-config.js: Truffle configuration file Create Contract You can write your own smart contract or download the ERC20 token smart contract template.

They can be added permanently via a config file <datadir>/geth/trusted-nodes.json or temporary via RPC call. Sync Mode Fast Sync The default sync mode. Synchronizes a node doing a fast synchronization by downloading the entire state database, requesting the headers first, and filling in block bodies and receipts afterward. Once the fast sync reaches the best block of the BizNet network, it switches to full sync mode. Full Sync Synchronizes a node starting at genesis, verifying all blocks and executing all transactions. This mode is a bit slower than the fast sync mode but comes with increased security. Steps to Run a Node Sync From Snapshot This is being prepared. Sync From Genesis Block 1.Build from source code Make sure that you have installed Go 1.13+ and have added GOPATH to PATH environment variable git clone https://github.com/bosagora/go-ethereum # Enter the folder go-ethereum was cloned into cd go-ethereum # Compile and install go-ethereum make geth or you can download the pre-build binaries from release page or follow the instructions below: # Linux wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bosagora/go-ethereum/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep linux |cut -d\\\" -f4) unzip linux.zip # MacOS wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bosagora/go-ethereum/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep mac |cut -d\\\" -f4) unzip mac.zip 2.Download the config files Download genesis.json and config.toml by: ## mainet wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bosagora/go-ethereum/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep mainnet |cut -d\\\" -f4) unzip mainnet.zip ## testnet wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bosagora/go-ethereum/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep testnet |cut -d\\\" -f4) unzip testnet.zip 3.Write genesis state locally geth --datadir node init genesis.json You could see the following output: INFO [05-19|14:53:17.468] Allocated cache and file handles database=/Users/michael/Downloads/go-ethereum/node/geth/chaindata cache=16.00MiB handles=16 INFO [05-19|14:53:17.498] Writing custom genesis block INFO [05-19|14:53:17.501] Persisted trie from memory database nodes=21 size=56.84KiB time=357.915\u00b5s gcnodes=0 gcsize=0.00B gctime=0s livenodes=1 livesize=-574.00B INFO [05-19|14:53:17.502] Successfully wrote genesis state database=chaindata hash=7d79cc\u2026fb0d1e INFO [05-19|14:53:17.503] Allocated cache and file handles database=/Users/michael/Downloads/go-ethereum/node/geth/lightchaindata cache=16.00MiB handles=16 INFO [05-19|14:53:17.524] Writing custom genesis block INFO [05-19|14:53:17.525] Persisted trie from memory database nodes=21 size=56.84KiB time=638.396\u00b5s gcnodes=0 gcsize=0.00B gctime=0s livenodes=1 livesize=-574.00B INFO [05-19|14:53:17.528] Successfully wrote genesis state database=lightchaindata hash=7d79cc\u2026fb0d1e 4.Start your node ## start a node geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node Node Maintainence Binary All the clients are suggested to upgrade to the latest release. The latest version is supposed to be more stable and get better performance. Storage According to the test, the performance of a node will degrade when the storage size exceeds 1.5T. We suggest the node always keep light storage by pruning the storage. How to prune: Stop the node. Run nohup geth snapshot prune-state --datadir {the data dir of your node} & . It will take 3-5 hours to finish. Start the node once it is done. The maintainers should always have a few backup nodes. The hardware is also important, make sure the SSD meets: 2T GB of free disk space, solid-state drive(SSD), gp3, 8k IOPS, 250MB/S throughput, read latency <1ms . Light Storage When the node crashes or been force killed, the node will sync from a block that was a few minutes or a few hours ago. This is because the state in memory is not persisted into the database in real time, and the node needs to replay blocks from the last checkpoint once it start. The replaying time dependents on the configuration TrieTimeout in the config.toml. We suggest you raise it if you can tolerate with long replaying time, so the node can keep light storage.

A crypto wallet is a device or program used for transfer and storage of cryptocurrency. Crypto wallets can be of different types, such as paper wallets, hardware wallets, and software wallets. There are also several smartphone mobile apps and computer programs that provide a user-friendly way to create and manage wallets. Along with crytocurreny, crypto wallets store a collection of crypto keys that are used for sending, receiving, and taracking ownership of cryptocurrencies. A keypair is a cryptographically-derived securely generated private and public keys. A private key and its corresponding public key are together known as a keypair. A wallet contains a collection of one or more keypairs and provides some means to interact with them. The security of any crypto wallet depends upon how the private key is stored. The public key is known as the wallet's receiving address or simply its address. The wallet address may be shared and displayed freely. When another party is going to send some amount of cryptocurrency to a wallet, they need to know the wallet's receiving address. Depending on a blockchain's implementation, the address can also be used to view certain information about a wallet, such as viewing the balance, but has no ability to change anything about the wallet or withdraw any tokens. In order to send cryptocurrencies to another address or to make any changes to the wallet, the private key is used for digitally signing the transactions. It is important to note that the private key must never be shared and should always be kept securely. If by any means access is gained to the private key attached to a wallet, the attacker can withdraw all the tokens contained. Furthermore, if the private key for a wallet is lost, any tokens that have been sent to or stored in that wallet's address are permanently lost. Different wallet solutions offer different approaches to keypair security, interacting with the keypair, and signing transactions to use/spend the tokens. Some are easier to use than others. Some store and back up private keys more securely. BizNet supports several wallets, giving its users the right to choose the right wallet for their required security and convenience. If you want to be able to receive BOA and other supported tokens on the BizNet blockchain, you will first need to create a wallet and configure key management .
